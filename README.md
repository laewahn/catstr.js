Cats'tr.js is an easy to use JavaScript library that will push the cat content of your application to its limits! It integrates nicely with Angular.js, React.js, Node.js and many more!

Cats'tr is so easy to use that we could not bother writing extensive documentation, but we will provide you with a "Hello world" example. You might figure out the rest by yourself. Meow!
